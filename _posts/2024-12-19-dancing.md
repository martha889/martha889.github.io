I always used to think that dancing is not my thing. But, regularly attending parties and other social events, I'm finding a new joy in dancing. The way friends and strangers smile at you when you try something new and imitate you. And the same way you do for them. You learn new steps, and in a way learning that new step is learning about that person, and that brings you closer. I believe that's what art is about: to bring people closer. When you express yourself unafraid in the form of a new dance step, you are telling the world this is how I am and it is up to the world to accept you.

You can't replace the smile and the glowing faces you get when you dance with someone and you are connecting in the form of those movements. Mimicking the lyrics is one way to invent new steps. But, mostly it's just about loving yourself and loving other people. Life in the form of art.

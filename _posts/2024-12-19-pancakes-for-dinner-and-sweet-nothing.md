In the song "Pancakes for dinner", Lizzy expresses her love for a person in the simplest of ways. She imagines the two of them having pancakes for dinner, watching TV as they lie comfortably next to each other, some parts on top of each other, dressing up, looking beautiful and going out, and coming back to the place they have built for each other. She recalls the feeling this person evokes in her while she is on a flight, afraid that the plane might crash.

Now I understand what it means to build a home together with someone. Every article of clothing, every thing you placed in every place has a story behind it. That time you tried that dress and the lady that looked askance. That time when we crossed the road and you held my hand like you had some ownership over me. I felt that. I do feel you have that over me.

In "Sweet Nothing", Taylor recalls a pebble that she picked up with her partner when they travelled to Wicklow. She recalls how the world outside is so crowded, always asking something of her, and how she comes back to her partner softly humming in the kitchen. She wants that sweet nothing that he does. I especially like the wordplay on sweet nothings: her partner asking nothing from her and how sweet it is and the actual meaning of the phrase, the sweet things that he tells her.

"And the voices that implore, you should be doing more
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it."
